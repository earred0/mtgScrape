# mtgScrape
In an attempt to learn how to webscrape, I scraped all of the standard legal cards created in the past 8 years and compiled them into a CSV. Originally I was going to use beautiful soup to decode Scryfall, but their code was presented in a very clean matter, it was not necessary. 

I then practiced manipulating the data using pandas and matplotlib. dataScrape.py consists of a script that plots the rarity distrbution on a single page in a simple and visually pleasing way. 

The next goal is to import the CSV file into a mySQL server.
