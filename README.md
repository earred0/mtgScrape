# mtgScrape
The goal of this project is to gather data on Magic the Gathering sets and store the data in various manners. 
What to do with the data is to come...

main.py is the script. It is looking at the html document from scryfall and grabbing information from there. 
setData.csv is the first attempt at organizing the data in the CSV format. Next goal is to store the data in a SQL server.
